# Start bind. In the past it was more secure to run BIND as a non-root
# user (for example, with '-u daemon'), but the modern version of BIND
# knows how to use the kernel's capability mechanism to drop all root
# privileges except the ability to bind() to a privileged port and set
# process resource limits, so -u should not be needed.  If you wish to
# use it anyway, chown the /var/run/named and /var/named directories to
# the non-root user.

# You might also consider running BIND in a "chroot jail",
# a discussion of which may be found in
# /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs/Chroot-BIND-HOWTO.
 
# One last note:  rndc has a lot of other nice features that it is not
# within the scope of this start/stop/restart script to support.
# For more details, see "man rndc" or just type "rndc" to see the options.

# Start BIND.  As many times as you like.  ;-)
# Seriously, don't run "rc.bind start" if BIND is already
# running or you'll get more than one copy running.
